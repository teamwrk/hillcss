## Documentation

### Why hillcss

Layouting should be separate from project Module styling. So we decided to create a toolkit of Sass functions and Markup helpers to realise a layouting framework that is lightweight and can be used independently.

Hillcss covers all basic aspects of modern CSS layouting and it has also even more advantages:

* Fits perfectly into your project
* No more custom layouting
* Generates only that parts you need
* Very Lightweight 0.5KB (Full Configuration, GZip)
* A simple and intuitive Grid-System
* Helpers for both Sass and HTML
* Well thought out by developers for developers

### Get hillcss

```
$ npm i hillcss --save

## Use hillcss

Now load Hillcss into your Sass project. Load `hill-api.scss` instead of `hill.scss` file in order to use only the Sass API.

```
@import 'node_modules/hill/hill';
