## Documentation
Visit the [Hillcss documentation](docs/README.md) for all the things.

## Release History
See the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

## Contributions and Bugfixes
Both are very much appreciated! As for contributions, the goals of this project are to keep things very simple, so if we don't accept a feature addition, it's not necessarily because it's a bad idea. It just may not meet the goals of the project. Thanks!
